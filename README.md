### Hi there, I am Chun Yen Fei  ðŸ‘‹ 

As a skilled Front-End Developer, I bring a diverse background in project management and VFX artistry to my work, specializing in creating modern, user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience. With two major projects already completed in a high-intensity program, including a pure JS e-commerce website and a React-based project management platform, I have developed a solid foundation in front-end development over the past two years, and I'm always striving to improve and grow my skills as a full-stack engineer.

My passion for programming extends beyond just creating aesthetically pleasing designs; I'm motivated by using my skills and abilities to make a positive impact in the world. As an efficient team player, I enjoy working collaboratively with others and bring an open-minded approach to problem-solving, always looking for innovative solutions to complex challenges. I'm eager to continue learning and adapting to new technologies and techniques, and I look forward to contributing my expertise to new projects and teams.
